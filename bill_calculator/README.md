# Bill Calculator 💡

This is a simple C program that calculates the total bill based on unit price and quantity. It was created as part of my C learning journey.

## 📁 Files

- `bill_calculator.c`: The main C source code.
- `saying.txt`: Notes explaining the program.

## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Compile using GCC:
gcc bill_calculator.c -o bill_calculator.exe
2. Run the executable:
./bill_calculator.exe
*Make sure you are in the folder where `bill_calculator.c` is saved.*


### 🏃 Method 2: Using run.bat (Windows Only)

Double-click the file named `run.bat`   
It will automatically compile and run the code for you.

Here's how `run.bat` looks:
```bat
@echo off
gcc bill_calculator.c -o bill_calculator.exe
bill_calculator.exe
pause
```
